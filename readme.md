#CHATAPP - LIVE CHATWALL AND SCORE

This project is based on PHP, Redis, Pusher API and HybridAuth. This application provides an embeddable live chatwall with social login. Pusher is used for pub/sub and redis is used for maintaining history of closed chats and for providing chat history to users joining in late to the conversation since Pusher does not have a History API. The PHP framework in use is Laravel (stable 2.x release). On the UI front it uses Jquery, Jquery UI, Wijmo Open Widgets and 99lime.com's fantastic HTML Kickstart.
